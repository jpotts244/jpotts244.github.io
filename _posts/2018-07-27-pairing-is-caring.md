## What is pairing, anyway?
**Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one computer.

One, the **driver**, writes code while the other, the observer or **navigator**, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## There are many different ways to pair
 - Driver & Navigator Pairing

 - Ping-Pong Pairing

 - Remote via screen sharing tools

 - Strong Style Pairing


## Sometimes things go bad when you pair

But there is comfort in knowing that you have another person there by your side with the exact amount of context as you to help you come to a resolution quicker and as the old saying goes: two heads are better than one, especially in a time of stress.

## Sometimes things go great when you pair


## Sometimes you know your pair a long, long time

Like for 10 years. This is me and my fiance Scott. He loves Ruby.

## Sometimes you just met your pair
I like to use pairing as a means to on-boarding new engineers to the team. Pairing is a great way to share context and a great way to get to know your new team members.

## Sometimes your pair lives in the woods

The great thing about pairing is you can do it anywhere! There are some powerful resources out there for remote pairing, all you really need is a computer, internet access, and a winning attitude.

What did you like about pairing?
What did you dislike about pairing?
Did you find it helpful?
Would you do it again?

## TLDR;
### Thank you to all my pairs, past, present, and future
You have taught me lessons I will hold with me for the rest of my life both as a developer and as a person and I will be forever grateful.
