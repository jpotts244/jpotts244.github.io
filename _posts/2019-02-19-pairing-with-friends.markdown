Pair programing is my favorite way to write code. It is a great tool to get instant feedback and reduce the size of feedback loops in the development process all while making some life long friends along the way. Today we will discuss a brief overview of the benefits of pair programming and ways to build trust and friendships while pairing (you know, so people would want to continue to pair with you).

**What is pairing anyway?**

**New to pairing or coding in general?**
Whether it is your first day at a new job or your first day writing code, pairing has got your back. Pairing with a more experienced developer will allow you to get your hands in the codebase on day 1. You don't have to worry about setting up your local environment (and the hours and hours of fun that might entail) and it will give you an opportunity to get exposed to the patterns and conventions of your new codebase.

This will be a great opportunity to ask any questions about the codebase right off the bat and it will be a great way to learn more about your coworkers. Trust me, the learning curve is much smaller when you're being guided by a more experienced engineer.

**Pairing is a great way to learn about a new codebase**

**Pairing is a great way to asses interview candidates**

**Pairing is a great way to share context and prevent code silos**

**Pairing is a great way to stay focused on the task at hand**
I'm not sure about you but when I am left to my own devices I usually end up down some rabbit holes.

```
  def hello_friend()
    puts "hi"
```
