WIP: Conducting some research, more coming soon.

### What is pairing, anyway?
**Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one computer.

One, the **driver**, writes code while the other, the observer or **navigator**, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

### There are many different ways to pair
Driver & Navigator Pairing

Ping-Pong Pairing

Remote via screen sharing tools

Strong Style Pairing

Etc Etc


### Sometimes you get to write some cool tools when you pair
[Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/chazelton331/pomodoro)

**bonus points if said tools help you pair better**

### Sometimes things go bad when you pair
But there is comfort in knowing that you have another person there by your side with the exact amount of context as you to help you come to a resolution quicker.


### Sometimes things go great when you pair


### Sometimes you use non-verbal communication with your pair


### Sometimes you know your pair a long, long time
Like for 10 years.

### Sometimes you just met your pair


### Sometimes your pair lives in the woods
