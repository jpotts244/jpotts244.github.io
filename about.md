Hello there!

My name is Jackie Potts and I am a full stack Ruby on Rails engineer from NYC. I used to be a professional orchestral cellist but I found programming to be too much fun. Now I'm doing my best to never stop learning, growing, and pairing.

Outside of computering, I love to climb mountains with my dog.
